<h2>why APNG rules</h2>

<P>
Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
What?! He is here. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Ye-ha! Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

You don't believe in the Force, do you? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't underestimate the Force. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

You don't believe in the Force, do you? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions?
