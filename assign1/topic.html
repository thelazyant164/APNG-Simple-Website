<h1>APNG rules!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What is it?</h2>

<P>
It extends the popular Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format specification to allow images to be animated similarly to animated GIF files with additional features.

The first frame of an APNG file is stored as a normal PNG. Since it is an extension of PNG, most standard decoders will be able to display the file without additional work.

Basically it is a PNG file with additional chunks of data to allow for animations

</p>
<hr>

<h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>It was first developed by Mozilla Corporation in 2004 to store animations needed in UIs (e.g. loading throbbers) to replace MNG animations which were deprecated the year before. MNGs had less functionality than APNGs with a much larger file size due to their decoder, the thing that will read the read and extract headers from the sequence of bytes.</p>
<h3>Why isn't it more mainstream?</h3>
<p>APNG had a lukewarm reception on release as maintainers on the PNG format debated that their format was strictly a single-image format and it was seen as such in the wider community. The rationale was that applications do not need and will not support multiple images per file due to having separate file formats for animations because a single image and a sequence of images are fundamentally used differently.
</p>
<p>The only way for a software to correctly distinguish between PNG and APNG is by reading the ancillary chunks which aren’t required to use PNGs, so if a software didn’t know about APNGs, the first frame would show up as a typical PNG.
</p>
<p>So with the maintainers of the file format against the idea of this implementation and the data of the animation hidden inside ancillary chunks that decoders used in applications could skip, APNG never grew in popularity.

<h2>Features/How does it work?</h2>
<h3>File structure</h3>
<p>Since the APNG is an extension on the PNG file format, the base structure of the file/datastream is the same.</p>

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

You don't believe in the Force, do you? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't underestimate the Force. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

You don't believe in the Force, do you? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?
</p>

<p>
Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions?
